# Introduction

Experimental pipeline as an alternative to POLARBEAR's AnalysisBackend — Refactorize, modernize, cythonize, parallelize.

The name TAIL is a word play on POLARBEAR's AnalysisBackend — the "backend of polarbear", which has the shortest tails among living bears. Symbolically, TAIL should be like a tail of a polarbear — you never notice it in front of this powerful polarbear.
